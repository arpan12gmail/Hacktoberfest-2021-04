<h2>Same Page Different Stylesheet</h2>
<p class="content">Style sheets represent a major breakthrough for
     Web page designers, expanding their ability to improve the appearance
      of their pages. In the scientific environments in which the Web was conceived, 
      people are more concerned with the content of their documents than the presentation.
       As people from wider walks of life discovered the Web, the limitations of HTML became
        a source of continuing frustration and authors were forced to sidestep HTML's stylistic
         limitations</p>

   <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Some more Style sheet</h2> 

<p class="content">
    Style sheets solve these problems at the same time 
    they supersede the limited range of presentation mechanisms in HTML.
     Style sheets make it easy to specify the amount of white space between 
     text lines, the amount lines are indented, the colors used for the text
      and the backgrounds, the font size and style, and a host of other details.

   <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Side Bar</h2> 

<p class="content">
    Placing style sheets in separate files makes them easy to reuse. Sometimes 
    it's useful to include rendering instructions within the document to which they apply, 
    either grouped at the 
    start of the document, or in attributes of the elements throughout the body of the document.

<p class="content" style="font-size: 11px;text-align: center;">
    This is the capability provided by some style sheet languages such as CSS to allow
     style information from several sources to be blended together. These could be, for 
     instance, corporate style guidelines, styles common to a group of documents, and styles
      specific to a single document. By storing these separately, style sheets can be reused, 
      simplifying authoring and making more effective use of network caching. The cascade defines
       an ordered sequence of style sheets where rules in later sheets have 
    greater precedence than earlier ones. Not all style sheet languages support cascading.
    HTML allows authors to specify documents in a media-independent way.
